# Tandem SEApprentice Challenge 2020

## How to run the code
- After downloading the repo into your code editor, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' to install all the necessary dependencies. Then run the code my typing 'yarn start' into the console.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## Challenges

- For some reason, the create-react-app I normally use on my computer did not properly work, and I was forced to reinstall it, which seemingly runs a little different to what I am used to. As a result, I had some difficulty with React behaving slightly different from what I am used to.
- I had some issues with figuring out whether to place certain state values in the parent or child components so that I could access and update them as desired.
- I started this challenge rather late and so felt rushed to complete as much as I could within my free time.

## What I Would Like To Revisit/Improve

- I would definitely like to add styling to make this look more presentable given the time.
- Currently I only have 2 major components holding the logic of the trivia app. I would love to refactor it into smaller and more reusable components.
- I feel that this app runs a bit slow when refreshing the page, and I suspect it may have to do with the 10 differnt questions being ever present and rerendering constantly. I would love to go back and update the app to figure out a way to not have all 10 questions rendered at the same time.
